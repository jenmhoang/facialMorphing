main.py: this file takes two input images, asks for points (or reads a text
file holding saved points), and produces a gif that morphs between the two

average.py: this file takes in database directories for images/points,
parses/collects them, and calculates the mean average image from the given
images. It then produces shape morphing between an input image and this
computed mean image.
